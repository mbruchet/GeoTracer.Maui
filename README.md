**MAUI Blazor Authentication Sample**

This project demonstrates how to build a cross-platform application using .NET MAUI Blazor, integrating MudBlazor for the UI components. The primary goal of this application is to showcase how the application can interact with an API to provide a simple authentication mechanism.

***Features***

Cross-platform Development: Utilizes .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) with Blazor to create a single codebase for multiple platforms.
UI Components: Integrated MudBlazor library for a rich and responsive user interface.
Secure Authentication: Implements a secure authentication mechanism that hashes passwords using SHA256, ensuring that passwords are not stored in plaintext neither on the server nor on the client side.

***Technologies Used***
.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI): A framework for building native device applications spanning mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Blazor: A framework for building interactive web UIs with C#.
MudBlazor: A Material Design component library for Blazor.
ASP.NET Core: A cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications.
